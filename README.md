## About Myself

Well… nothing too fancy, but here’s my story:

My journey into computer science started in 12th grade. The first time I got introduced to programming, it wasn’t the theory that hooked me—it was the lab sessions. Writing code, running it, and actually seeing the system do what I told it to? That was magic to me.

At that time, I was also thinking hard about my future. I dreamed of unbelievable things—exploring space, pushing boundaries, and just thinking things that seemed impossible. Before that, I was really into football and thought I might go pro, but by 12th grade reality hit, and I was clueless about my path.

Interestingly, I took computer science somewhat on a whim because my sister did CS in her 12th grade, and my cousin was also studying it. But once I started, I got hooked and decided to pursue a Bachelor’s in CS. During my degree, I explored various domains in the IT industry and learned about the different teams within a tech company. With so many options, it was exciting but also a bit confusing. Then came the rise of AI, and the hype around it really caught my attention. While I initially focused on web development, I found myself increasingly drawn toward Artificial Intelligence. In the foreseeable future, I plan to pursue a Master’s in AI and ML, but for now, I’m building a strong foundation by working toward becoming a well-rounded Full Stack Developer.
