# Hi, I’m Vishnu Prasad

## About Me

I chose Computer Science because of the constant challenges and endless opportunities to grow. I’ve always been fascinated by backend development—there’s so much to explore, and every project brings new challenges to solve.

I’m a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on JavaScript (MERN, TypeScript) and Python (Django, FastAPI). I enjoy building scalable web applications, designing RESTful APIs, and creating projects that combine frontend elegance with backend robustness.

Aside from tech, I’m a football enthusiast who enjoys playing on the field, a gamer during downtime, and an occasional reader.
