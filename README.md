Hello, I'm Vishnu Prasad — an aspiring Data Scientist and Full-Stack Developer -Python (Django), React, and PostgreSQL (also MERN).

About my educational background, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2025 in there, I made my fundamentals stronger and worked on many projects. I maintained a 7.8 CGPA throughout the whole course. 

And what got me hooked up with CS — I realized that programming or computer science was my thing when I was in my 12th grade, When I wanted some tasks to be done or automate something, I would just write some code in a few files and execute it on the system, and the computer would do it for me. That's when I decided that I wanted to be a Software Engineer, and this was the time when I was broken because I couldn't be a footballer. I was actively thinking about what I wanted to become. I took Computer Science as my stream in 12th on a whim. Well, it turned out to be a good decision.

About my hobbies — I play games and spend a lot of time on different ones. I also read books sometimes, though I’ve only completed two series — both from the same franchise, which also happens to be my favorite.
About my technical knowledge — I am really good with Python, Javascript, Postgresql. I use Django with Restframework in backend, and for building APIs. For the frontend, I mostly use ReactJS, and some css frameworks.To increase my expertise with Python and web development, i am trying to learn about FastAPI, microservices, asynchronous programming. 

About my future — I want to ba a AI/ML Engineer to be specific i want to be in a research kind of role, I want to improve the current AI, to make it better, to make it think for itself or something
like a human.

and well thats all about me in consice manner.
